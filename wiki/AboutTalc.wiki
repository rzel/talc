= About Talc =

Talc is currently implemented as a compiler to JVM bytecode. The command-line interface is roughly equivalent to that of other scripting languages.

See TalcManPage for the full manual, translated to code.google.com's wiki markup format from the original groff(1) source by a Talc script.
