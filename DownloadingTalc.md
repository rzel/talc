# How to download Talc #

Until we have stand-alone native binaries (suitable for #! use), Talc is only available in source form. Please see the BuildingTalc instructions.

The plan is to make at least a Debian package available, containing a stand-alone binary. Ideally, the package would be available from the Debian repositories directly. If you'd like to help with this (especially if you're already a Debian package maintainer and would like to maintain a Talc package), please let me know.

I don't think Talc's yet ready for people who aren't happy building from source, though.
