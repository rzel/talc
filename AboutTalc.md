# About Talc #

Talc is now implemented as a full compiler to JVM bytecode. The command-line interface is roughly equivalent to that of other scripting languages. The procedural parts of the language are complete, but the object-oriented parts are still somewhat basic. The standard library is small but regular, and surprisingly expressive. Performance is comparable to most other scripting languages.

See TalcManPage for the full manual, translated to code.google.com's wiki markup format from the original groff(1) source by a Talc script (linked to from the footer of the page itself).
