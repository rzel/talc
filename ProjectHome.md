The language Talc is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy programming. It is simple, straightforward, and aimed at aficionados of the C family, despite its Pascal-inspired declarations. Particularly notable features are static typing, mostly C-like syntax, and the all-important  curly braces. (As Dennis Ritchie said, "C’s intellectual influence on the semantic design of new languages has been  small. On the other hand, it has influenced notation: even pseudo-code these days tends to contain curly braces.")

If you want a convenient language for quick little jobs, love  the C family, like  static  typing, dislike Perl’s complexity and obscurity, dislike Python’s needless breaks from tradition, have been disappointed by Ruby’s irregularities, and most of all don’t want to throw the baby of good compile-time error checking out with the bathwater of verbosity of simple tasks, Talc may be the language for you.
